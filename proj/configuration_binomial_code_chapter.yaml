hypothesis: "
In this thesis chapter, we demonstrate how to design a 2D superconducting circuit for generating states of the binomial code and how to experimentally implement arbitrary binomial states. The 2D architecture allows for even more hardware efficiency and scalability, making it a promising candidate for future quantum error correction. We will show that the binomial code can be implemented in a 2D architecture using superconducting circuits, and we will discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach. We will also present the requirements for implementing binomial codes in a 2D architecture and detail the device design process using SQuADDS and HFSS. Finally, we will discuss potential future work in the field of quantum error correction using binomial codes in superconducting circuits.

\n
For the section 'Cavity spectroscopy' you should explain the process of cavity spectroscopy and its importance in characterizing the cavity used for bosonic encoding. The calibration consists of applying a pulse to the cavity followed by excitation pulse on the qubit. This is a coarse way to measure the cavity frequency. The cavity frequency is determined by fitting the data to a lorentzian function.
\n
For the section 'Dispersive shift chi between qubit and cavity' you should discuss the dispersive shift and its significance in qubit-cavity systems. The calibration consists of applying an excitation pulse to the cavity followed by a photon-selective pi pulse on the qubit followed by readout. The amplitude of the excitation pulse is swept from 0 to a maximum value. For higher values of amplitude, the average number of photons in the cavity increases leading a shift to the qubit frquency via the AC stark shift. The dispersive shift chi is the distance between the different adjacent peaks in the data. The number of peaks is equal to the number of photons in the cavity.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of Photon-Number Selective pi pulses' you should explain the process of calibrating photon-number selective π pulses, which are crucial for manipulating the bosonic states in binomial codes. This calibration is similar to a power rabi calibration.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of displacement strength alpha' you should discuss the calibration of the displacement operator strength. This calibration involves displacing the cavity with some amplitude and then applying a photon-selective pi pulse on the qubit, followed by readout. The amplitude of the displacement pulse is swept from 0 to a maximum value. Mention the fit of the data to a poisson distribution to determine the amplitude of the displacement pulse needed to generate a certain displacement characterized by alpha.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of photon number parity' you should explain the process of calibrating photon number parity measurements. Mention that this parity calibration is going to be used when plotting the wigner function of the state, which is the main technique used to characterize and visualize the state of the bosonic mode. The calibration involves displacing the cavity with a pulse of variable amplitude but fixed length, a pi/2 pulse on the qubit, wait for some time t, which we call revival time and is equal to 1/2 chi, another pi/2 pulse on the qubit, followed by a pi pulse on the qubit conditioned on 1 photon in the cavity followed by readout. The amplitude of the displacement pulse is swept from 0 to a maximum value. The parity is calculated by fitting the data to an exponential decay function. The readout voltage at 0 displacement amplitude corresponds to parity of +1, while the readout voltage at large amplitudes corresponds to -1 parity.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of revival time' you should discuss the concept of revival time in bosonic systems and explain how it is calibrated. The revival time calibration is a more accurate way to calibrate the wait time between pi/2 pulses used in wigner tomography. Explain what the revival time is. The calibration is similar to the parity calibration but the displacement pulse amplitude is fixed and the time between pi/2 pulses is swept. The resulting data is a sinusoidal function of the wait time. The revival time is defined as the time it takes the function to go from its starting value to the next extremum, indicating parity change.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of wigner tomography' you should explain the process of calibrating Wigner tomography, a crucial technique for characterizing the quantum states of bosonic modes. 
\n
For the section 'Introduction to raman driving of transmon qubits' you should provide an overview of Raman driving in transmon qubits, explaining its principles and potential applications in implementing binomial codes. Raman driving in superconducting qubits is an advanced quantum control technique that utilizes multi-level energy structures to manipulate quantum states. This method is particularly useful for implementing coherent state transfers, quantum gates, and creating effective Λ-type systems in superconducting circuits. The technique involves driving the qubit 0-1 and 1-2 transitions simultaneously with two tones, which transfers population from 0 to 2. In addition, this technique can be used to create photon number states by driving the qubit and cavity simultaneously.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of raman pulses' you should discuss the process of calibrating Raman pulses, explaining their importance in manipulating the qubit-cavity system for binomial code implementation. This calibration involves sweeping the two parameters of the simultaneous drives and seeing which combination gives the highest readout signal.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of relation between cavity and qubit amplitudes' you should explain how the relationship between cavity and qubit amplitudes is calibrated and why this is important for implementing binomial codes. This calibration involves sweeping the amplitude of the cavity drive and the amplitude of the qubit drive and observing the readout signal.
\n
For the section 'Calibration of raman gate length' you should discuss how the duration of Raman gates is calibrated and optimized for efficient state manipulation in binomial code implementation. This calibration involves sweeping the duration of the cavity-qubit drive vs the frequency of the qubit drive. This also gives us information on the frequency correction we need to apply to the qubit drive due to the ac stark effect.
\n
The section 'Creation of fock state using SNAP gates results', you should describe the results of creating a Fock state using SNAP gates and show the experimental results.
\n
The section 'creation of fock state using SNAPPA', you should explain the process of creating a Fock state using SNAPPA and show results.
\n
The section 'creation of binomial code states', you should detail the process of creating binomial code states and show results for a few states.
\n
The section 'Conclusions', you should provide a conclusion to the chapter.
\n
The section 'Future work', you should discuss potential future work in optimizing pulse shape envelopes to maximize gate fidelity and shorten gate times by comparing machine learning optimization techniques to standard optimization techniques.
\n
